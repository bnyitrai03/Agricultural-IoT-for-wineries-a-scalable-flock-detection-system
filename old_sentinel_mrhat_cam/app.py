class App:

    Main application class for managing camera operations and MQTT communication.

    This class handles the image capture, message creation and sending, and periodic execution of
    the tasks based on the provided configuration. Based on the provided configuration,
    the application either sleeps or shuts down the device between the image captures.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config_path : str
        Path to the configuration file.
    logger : Logger
        Logger instance for handling log messages.

    Attributes
    ----------
    config : Config
        Configuration object containing application settings.
    camera : Camera
        Camera object for capturing images.
    mqtt : MQTT
        MQTT client for message publishing and receiving.
    schedule : Schedule
        Schedule the running of the application, and handle the shut down timing.
    logger : Logger
        Logger instance for handling log messages.
    transmit : Transmit
        Transmitter object for creating and sending messages.

        Periodically takes pictures and sends them over MQTT, based on the period it will
        either shut down between sending two pictures, or just wait within the script.

        This method runs an infinite loop that periodically captures and transmits images based on the
        application's configuration. It checks for a new configuration update before each iteration
        and updates the application's settings if necessary. The method determines whether the device
        should shut down or sleep between image captures based on the time elapsed during transmission
        and the configured period.

        Workflow
        --------
        - Check if a new configuration has been received by the MQTT client.
        - If a new configuration is detected, update the application's settings and acknowledge the receipt.
        - Capture an image and transmit it via MQTT.
        - Measure the time taken to complete the transmission.
        - Determine whether the device should shut down or simply wait for the remainder of the period
        based on the transmission time.
        - If a shutdown is required, manage boot data, initiate the shutdown, and log relevant information.
        - If no shutdown is needed, wait for the remaining time or until a new configuration is received.

        Raises
        ------
        SystemExit
            If an exception occurs during the periodic loop, the application will log the error and exit.
